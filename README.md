#WeatherAPI

## Hello Welcome to the readMe. page.
The motivation behind this page was to make a website API that would get the weather for 5 days and current weather. I was able to get the API calls but the rest I wasn't able to complete in the time given =/.
Through this project I learned:
* How to fetch server side APIs
* How to input data onto page from server side API
* How not to format an HTML/css page..
* Better understanding of jquery
* better understanding of bootstap
  
## Being new to web development I came across some issues you may see obvious such as:
* still having trouble with CSS formatting for html user side.
* putting current dates onto the page
* being over stressed with all the things requried
* 
 ## Instalation
